Project:
A library that implements a modbus protocol.

Prerequisites:

1) At the moment, I want to summarize all the experience gained in the modbus.

2) I saw a variety of incomplete implementation of this functional, and each
implementations plainly can not be moved to different platforms.

3) I want to create a fully portable sources, that can be work anywhere.
On such platforms like AVR, MSP430, ARM, with OS and without it.

Goals:

1) Realisation of modbus 1.1 protocol.

2) A most compilers must be able to build it.

3) Dependency of external libraries should be minimised.

4) A structure should be soft and simple.

5) In project can be used C language only. (exclude wrappers)

6) Structure should be able to create a simple wrappers.
